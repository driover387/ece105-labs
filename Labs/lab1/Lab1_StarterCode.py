Connect4 Starter Code

This code plays a random game of Connect 4 and checks for a win condition
The __main__ method will repeatedly play until a game with no winner is found

Variable convention:
nr: number of rows
nc: number of columns
b: board (6 rows, 7 columns)
c: column (1 of 7)
r: row (1 of 6)
p: player index (1 or 2)
